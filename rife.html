                <h2>TarHunt RSG </h2>
                <p>
                    In the days before sabot slugs, people used to boast of deer guns that could hit a 10-gallon milk can at 100 yards. 
                    The TarHunt brought us forever out of the realm of minute-of-milk-can accuracy and into the world of M.O.A. slug shooting.
                     Rifled barrels for shotguns had been around for only a few years when TarHunt inventor, Randy Fritz, reasoned if a slug
                      gun was going to shoot like a rifle, it should be built like a rifle. The TarHunt had a glass-bedded, a free-floating 
                      barrel, a McMillan fiberglass stock, and a rifle trigger. And, it shoots: the TarHunt can shoot MOA groups, although fiv
                      e shots under 2 inches is more common. By shotgun slug standards, that kind of accuracy is revolutionary. —P.B.

                <h2>Winchester Model 21 1931–1959 </h2>
                <p>
                    With graceful lines belying its exceptional strength, the Winchester Model 21 appeared in the midst of the Depression and 
                    survived to become an American classic. Joe DiMaggio shot a Model 21. So did a quail hunter from Kansas named Dwight Eisenhower.
                     When John Olin of Western Cartridge Co. bought bankrupt Winchester in 1931, the then new Model 21 came with it. Olin recognized 
                     the gun’s durability and devised an extreme torture test to promote it. He gathered the best guns from around the world and 
                     subjected them to a proof-load test, feeding each a diet of “blue pill” proof loads until it broke down.
                     The British Purdey failed after 60 shots. The Model 21 survived 2,000 unscathed. Winchester made it in all gauges and grades,

                <p>
                    Looking at it now, when it’s been around for 56 years, you wonder what all the fuss was about. But w
                    hen it debuted, the Mark V was about as radical a rifle as you could imagine. The joint product of
                     Roy Weatherby and designer Fred Jennie, the Mark V departed from tradition altogether. At a time when 
                     scopes were not entirely trusted, it had no iron sights as backup. When all rifles were drab wood and dull 
                     steel, the Weatherby had a mirror finish on both wood and metal. Two bolt lugs? No, there were nine small 
                     ones. It came left-handed, in a time when southpaw shooters were not known to exist by the gun industry.
