                    Every so often, a firearm comes along that redefines things. The Barrett M82A is one such. So is the Remington Nylon 66. And in 1955,
                     Smith & Wesson introduced one—the Model 29, a revolver so much more powerful than any other handgun that it forced shooters to redefine what a six-shooter was. Not only was the Model 29 a veritable hand cannon,
                     but it was a beautiful firearm, as finely made as any factory revolver to date. It was
                     equipped with semi-target sights, exotic-wood grips, a glassy-smooth action, and a presentation box. And then came Dirty Harry Callahan,
                      who did for the Model 29 what no other movie character has done for any other gun—he made it a star. There was a time when you could 
                      not buy a 29 unless you paid an insane price for it, and even then it was a struggle to find one. The only legitimate use for the Model 29 is hunting. It’s far too powerful for anything else. Probably, 
                    many of its owners fire it a few times and keep it around to admire thereafter. It’s that kind of gun. Check availability here. —D.E.P.

                <h2>Ruger Mark </h2>

                <p>
                    If the Model 110 is the Rifle That Saved Savage, the Mark I is the Pistol That Made Ruger. Now that Sturm, Ruger & Co. is
                     the fourth-largest firearms manufacturer in the U.S., it’s possible to forget that the company started in 1949 with one semiauto 
                     .22 pistol, and this was it. Ruger was a true original thinker, and the gun he came up with was dead simple to manufacture,
                      accurate, and reliable; it looked a little like a Luger and sold for the very reasonable price of $37.50. 
                      And it held that price for years and years. In a sense, Ruger did for handguns what Remington had done for centerfire rifles with 
                      the Model 721—brought them into a new age of design and manufacturing. —D.E.P.

                    Glock is a brand of polymer-framed, short recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-automatic pistols designed and produced by
                     Austrian manufacturer Glock Ges.m.b.H.
                    The firearm entered Austrian military and police service by 1982 after it was the top performer in reliability and safety tests.
                    In 1980, the Austrian Armed Forces announced that it would seek tenders for a new, modern duty pistol to replace their World War 
                    II–era Walther P38 handguns. The Federal Ministry of Defence of Austria formulated a list of 17 criteria for the new generation 
                    service pistol, including requirements that it would be self loading; fire the NATO-standard 9×19 mm Parabellum round; 
                    the magazines were not to require any means of assistance for loading; be secure against accidental discharge from shock,
